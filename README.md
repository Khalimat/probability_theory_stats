If you do not have textbooks, please, register [here](https://lib.mipt.ru/). No, it is not necessary to be a Phystech student, you just need to solve school-level problem in Physics.
All books are available there.

#### Questions to cover

I would suggest to use [YDS](https://yandexdataschool.ru/static/files/shad_program.pdf) programme

#### Problems to solve <3

Here you can find ~~catharses~~  a list of problems to solve. Enjoy!
- For years, telephone area codes in the United
States and Canada consisted of a sequence of three
digits. The first digit was an integer between 2 and
9, the second digit was either 0 or 1, and the third
digit was any integer from 1 to 9. How many area
codes were possible? How many area codes start-
ing with a 4 were possible?

- A committee of 7, consisting of 2 Republicans,
2 Democrats, and 3 Independents, is to be cho-
sen from a group of 5 Republicans, 6 Democrats,
and 4 Independents. How many committees are
possible?

- From a group of 8 women and 6 men, a committee
consisting of 3 men and 3 women is to be formed.
How many different committees are possible if
  - 2 of the men refuse to serve together?
  - 2 of the women refuse to serve together?
  - 1 man and 1 woman refuse to serve together?

- We have 20 thousand dollars that must be invested
among 4 possible opportunities. Each investment
must be integral in units of 1 thousand dollars,
and there are minimal investments that need to be
made if one is to invest in these opportunities. The
minimal investments are 2, 2, 3, and 4 thousand
dollars. How many different investment strategies
are available if
   - an investment must be made in each opportu-
nity?
   - investments must be made in at least 3 of the
4 opportunities?

- Determine the number of vectors
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28x_1%20%2C%20.%20.%20.%20%2C%20x_n%20%29)
such that each ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_i) is either 0 or 1 and: <br/>
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csum_%7B1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20x_i%20%5Cgeq%20k)

- The following identity is known as Fermat’s combinatorial identity:
![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbinom%7Bn%7D%7Bk%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bi%3Dk%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%5Cbinom%7Bi%20-1%7D%7Bk%20-1%7D%20%2C%20n%20%5Cgeq%20k). Give a combinatorial argument (no computations
are needed) to establish this identity.
Hint: Consider the set of numbers 1 through n.
How many subsets of size k have i as their highest-
numbered member?

Additionally, I recommend a [course](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/modern-combinatorics/mfti-JJjFq) taught by Phystech on Coursera.
